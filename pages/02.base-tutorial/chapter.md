In this tutorial we will get started building a website with Grav. Whether you want to blog about your life, share research, or provide information about projects you have been involved in, blogs are a common and useful format that are easy to produce with Grav.

I have put together a [demo website](http://ds-tutorials.oucreate.com/grav-demo/blog) to show what you can create with this tutorial. Please note that the website is also a demo for the mini tutorials, so if this base tutorial does not get you started with something you see there, one of the mini tutorials will.
