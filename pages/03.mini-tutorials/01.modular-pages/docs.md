## What is a modular page?

This mini tutorial will walk you through creating a simple modular page as the home page of your website. A modular page is one that is built out of several smaller pages, or modules. You may recall that the first page we created when building the blog was a _Blog_ page. Although this page has a bare minimum of content, it displays a set of subpages called _Items_ (blog posts). Modular pages are very similar. 

Some differences:

- Blog pages are constantly gaining/changing content as new posts are created. Modular pages have more static content.
- The pages shown by blog pages are real: That is, you can click on them and go to the page itself. The modules of a modular page do not exist on their own.
- A blog page may have a small amount of content - possibly limited to a title and subtitle. A modular page contains no content of its own whatsoever. All of the content is contained in the modules.
- The children of a modular page require a specific folder format. The folder for each section must begin with the underscore `_` character.

Modular pages are a popular choice for one-page websites, like this [demo site](https://demo.getgrav.org/onepage-skeleton/) created with the Quark theme.

Going back to the demo blog we created in the base tutorial, notice the navigation bar at the top. It lists two pages - Home and Blog - and makes it easy to switch between them. With a one-page website like the demo, the navigation bar will display various sections and scroll the page to that section when you click on it. This is an excellent feature for one-page websites and is the default in the Modular template. Because it does not work so well for multi-page websites we will have to fix this once we have created some content.

## Making Home Modular

Since we want the modular page to be our home page, we will need to replace the current home page. First we have to delete all the content from the content area. Since modular pages hold no content of their own, the content is completely unnecessary.

We also have to change the template the page is using. On the Advanced tab, change the template from default to modular and click _Save_.

![The option for Page Template is under Settings on the Advanced tab for the home page. An arrow points to the dropdown menu where Modular has been selected.](change-page-template.png)

Unfortunately there is one issue we will have to deal with. Because the page was originally using the default template, it is not setup properly. Looking at the Content tab, there is a section below Page Media called Modular Setup. It looks like it should, with `@self.modular` in the Items box. This is what we want.

![The new Modular Setup section is below Page Media on the Content tab. The first option is Items: @self.modular.](modular-setup.png)

Switch to expert mode and take a look at the frontmatter:

```yaml
title: Home
body_classes: 'title-center title-h1h2'
```

The Items option has not been set. That is a problem, because without it the modules we create will not show up on the page. Fortunately the fix is not very involved. Back in normal mode, make sure to click on the box with your cursor and then save. Nothing else is required. If you switch to expert mode, you should now see this in the frontmatter:

```yaml
title: Home
content:
    items: '@self.modular'
body_classes: 'title-center title-h1h2'
```

This is a potential issue any time we change the template of a page. Although the fields in the editor's normal mode will typically auto-fill, they may not actually be set in the frontmatter. Clicking on the field before saving can fix that by making sure the admin panel registers that the field needs to be set.

## Modular Hero

In the Quark theme, there are three types of modular templates: Hero, Features, and Text. You may recall the term 'hero' from working on the Blog page. A hero is essentially a large image with text on top. The Blog template has a hero header built in, which the content goes on top of. The Modular template does not, so if we want a hero-style header, we will have to add one.

If we try to add the page as normal, none of the three modular templates I mentioned are options. Instead, we have to go click the down arrow next to the **Add** button and choose _Add Modular_.

![Clicking the arrow on the right of the **Add** button lists three options. The third, _Add Modular_, is highlighted.](add-modular.png)

Because this module is going to become our header, it may be tempting to use _header_ as the title. Unfortunately, this will create issues within the template, because there is already a section called _header_. We do not want this to overwrite that, or we will lose our navigation bar!

!!! Author's note: I speak from experience about overwriting the navigation bar. It is almost embarrassing how long it took me to figure out why I had no navigation.

Make sure that the page this module belongs to is _Home_ and select the Modular Template _Hero_.

![Add Modular Content dialog box. Page Title: hero-header. Folder Name: hero-header. Page: --> (home) Home. Modular Template: Hero.](add-modular-settings.png)

Although the automatic folder name does not show an underscore at the front, there is no need to worry. When the folder is created it will have an underscore.

### Ordering

Before we add any content we should go ahead and make certain that any modules we create will be shown in the correct order. This can be done using numeric folder prefixes.

!!!! For more information about file structures and ordering pages a mini tutorial is in development.

The _Ordering_ section can be found in the right column on the _Advanced_ tab. Because _Folder Numeric Prefix_ is current disabled, _hero-header_ is listed under _Unsortable Pages_.

![The first item under the Ordering section is Folder Numeric Prefix, which has a toggle set to Disabled. Below that is the Sortable Pages section, with a note that this page is not sortable because the above option is not enabled. Then the page is shown under a list called Unsortable Pages.](folder-numeric-prefix.png)

Toggle prefix setting to Enabled and then save. Once the page has saved _hero-header_ will move to Sortable Pages as _01.hero-header_. Once we have created other modules with numeric prefixes this section will have a list that we can drag and drop to change the order of.

![The toggle for Folder Numeric Prefix is now set to Enabled. The note has disappeared, and there is no Unsortable Pages list. Instead, _01.hero-header_ is shown next to Sortable Pages.](prefix-enabled.png)

### Content

Now we can add some content. Because whatever we add will be displayed on top of the image we will upload, we do not want to write too much. I will settle for providing a title and subtitle:

```md
# Grav Demo Blog

### Theo Acker
```

I will also upload the snowflakes image from the [tutorial album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/theodwynn/albums/72157712814676952).

!!! The album is referenced in the base tutorial under **[Adding Media](https://www.ds-tutorials.oucreate.com/grav/base-tutorial/creating-content/adding-media)**.

While we do not _have_ to set this image as the hero image, it is good practice. We will also want to add the hero classes `CLIP: text-light overlay-dark-gradient`.
