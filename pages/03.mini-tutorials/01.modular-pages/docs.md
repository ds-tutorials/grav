This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple modular page as the home page of your website. A modular page is one that is built out of several smaller pages, or modules.

You may recall that the first page we created when building the blog was a Blog page. Although this page has a bare minimum of content, it displays a set of subpages called Items (blog posts). Modular pages are very similar. The biggest difference is that they contain no content of their own whatsoever. The children (subpages) of a modular page also require a specific folder format: the folder for each section has to start with the underscore `NOCLIP _` character.

Modular pages are a popular choice for one-page websites, like the [demo site](https://demo.getgrav.org/onepage-skeleton/) for the One Page skeleton for Quark.

You may notice that, in the website you created, switching between Home and Blog on the navigation bar changes pages. In contrast, the navigation bar of the One Page site scrolls down to the relevant section you clicked on. This works very well for one-page websites - not so much for multi-page sites.
